# Project-Radio-Los-Santos
 a player that simulates the ingame GTA San Andreas Radio system with callers, dj commentary, ads and of course the music
- the played track and random generation of playlists is synced using the internal device clock (which means that the app will play the same music if their internal clocks are more or less synced)
 
 - music keeps playing in the background using a background service
 
 - radio stations can be switched from the notification tray
